This is an implementation of the Digression guided Diffusion Disruption (**DDD**) framework. This framework first performs discretized textual optimization in token space to obtain a hard prompt. Subsequently, it generates adversarial noise through an untargeted attack in the hidden space of a masked context image. Our work provides **3 times faster execution** and **3 times lower VRAM usage** compared to PhotoGuard's attack. Additionally, we demonstrate **state-of-the-art performance** through our multi-modal target.
